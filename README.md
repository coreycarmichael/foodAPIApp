# foodAPIApp

Netlify: https://practical-meninsky-7fd8a6.netlify.app/

This is my third project while in bootcamp. I was partnered with one other person on this project.

The goal of this project was to pull from two separate API's. You can select what kind of meal and drink pairing you would like and get a new suggestion. If you can't decide, hit "Surprise Me" and get a randomly generated pairing. Once satisfied, you can then get the ingredients for both. Used JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS on this project. Thanks for checking this out.
